## 📌 Repository Overview

**This repository is developed by Muhammad Javed for learning and practice purposes.**

This repository focuses on **regularization techniques in supervised machine learning**, which are essential for improving **model generalization**, reducing **overfitting**, and handling **multicollinearity**.

The notebooks provide **conceptual explanations, mathematical intuition, and practical implementation** of regularization methods using Python and Scikit-learn.

This repository is intended as **study material**, not a deployment-ready project.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand overfitting and underfitting in supervised learning
- Learn why regularization is required in regression models
- Study L1, L2, and combined regularization techniques
- Analyze the effect of regularization on model coefficients
- Improve model generalization performance

---

## 🧠 Regularization Techniques Covered

### 🔹 Ridge Regression (L2)
- Penalizes the sum of squared coefficients
- Shrinks coefficients but does not make them zero
- Effective when all features contribute to prediction

### 🔹 Lasso Regression (L1)
- Penalizes the sum of absolute coefficients
- Performs feature selection by setting coefficients to zero
- Useful for sparse models

### 🔹 ElasticNet
- Combination of L1 and L2 regularization
- Balances feature selection and coefficient shrinkage
- Effective when features are highly correlated
